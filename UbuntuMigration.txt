While migrating from one platform to another, do the following:
    1. Use Remastersys to create a dtistributable copy of existing installation. or
    2.a Install fresh copy of same linux version.
    2.b Extract a list of packages installed in previous version by 
        dpkg -l | grep ^ii | awk '(print $2)' > installed
    2.c List will be saved in a file named "installed". Copy this file to new system.
    2.d In the newly installed OS, install the saved packages by:
        sudo apt-get install $(cat installed)
    3. Next step is copy a list of installed python packages from old installation to new one.
    3.a type in a terminal
        pip freeze > req.txt
    3.b Copy this "req.txt" file from old to new system.
    3.c in the new system, type
         pip --proxy http://usrename:password@proxyLink:port/ install -r req.txt
         pip --proxy https://usrename:password@proxyLink:port/ install -r req.txt
